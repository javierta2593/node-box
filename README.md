# Assignment 3

Navigate over to the "shared" directory to find all the files for assignment 3.

The way our functions work is that we hard coded the parameters we send over to the server and its functions that handle our data.

Our 5th and 6th functions do not return the correct value as we were having a difficult time passing an array and string over ajax correctly.  The data does get passed to the server and back to the client but because of the way that we parsed the data, we do not get the correct result.
